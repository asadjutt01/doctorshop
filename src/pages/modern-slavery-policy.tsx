                                        We consider the issues of slavery and human trafficking to be of utmost importance and have implemented measures, especially at our headquarters level, to identify and mitigate these risks across all our supply chains. Our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking include the following:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul className="content-section-list-none">

                                            - <strong>Verification:&nbsp;</strong> We assess and address risks of human trafficking and slavery by conforming to the Code, Section A.1, which explicitly prohibits forced labor, bonded labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, and trafficking of persons. We use the Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and the Validated Audit Process (VAP) to ensure conformance.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>- The SAQ is a self-evaluation tool that covers demographics and existing policies at the facility level, aligning with all sections of the Code.</li>
                                        <li>- The VAP audits are conducted by independent, third-party auditors specialized in social and environmental auditing, ensuring consistent industry-wide expectations.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            - <strong>Supplier Audits:&nbsp;</strong> We conduct VAP audits on our suppliers or obtain audit reports through this process, which remain valid for a maximum of two years. Additionally, we perform internal on-site audits annually for high-risk suppliers identified through the SAQ. These tools help us determine which suppliers to audit based on the risk levels associated with slave labor or human trafficking practices.
                                        </li>

                                            Some of our suppliers are located in countries that may pose a higher risk of human rights abuses. To manage this risk, we employ various methods, including:

                                        <li>- Evaluating factories of suppliers in higher-risk countries against recognized industry standards, utilizing internal and external resources.</li>
                                        <li>- Ensuring our supplier agreements include language that requires compliance with national and regional statutory requirements, including laws related to human trafficking, forced labor, and modern slavery.</li>

We work with suppliers to improve their standards through corrective action plans and ongoing reviews to maintain our standards. If a supplier fails to adequately address the issue, the relationship will be re-evaluated and potentially terminated.</li>
                                        <li>- <strong>Internal Accountability:&nbsp;</strong> Non-compliance with slavery and human trafficking is treated seriously. Corrective action plans must be implemented promptly to address any instances of non-conformance. For employees failing to meet our code on slavery and trafficking, disciplinary action, including dismissal, will be taken based on the decision of the disciplinary committee. Suppliers refusing to undertake corrective actions may have their business relationship terminated, as stipulated in the contract.</li>
